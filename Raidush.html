<h3><strong>Raidush, the god of natural disasters and anger</strong></h3>
<p>Raidush, while implied to be an angry god of destruction, is a rather calm person, only having fits of destructive rage. It&rsquo;s said that the angry god lives upon mount Eldur, the most violent volcano on the continent, where he spends his days in the hot lava. Raidush is also the only god with a domain in the mortal world, being that mountain.</p>
<h3><span id="Physical_description_and_known_manifestations" class="mw-headline">Physical description and known manifestations</span></h3>
<p>Raidush appears as a middle-aged man with a burn scar going across his chest and rising to his head, increasing in severity as it goes up. He&rsquo;s also said to manifest as a small miniature phoenix that appears to watch over mortals of interest to the fickle god.</p>
<h3><span id="Places_of_Worship" class="mw-headline">Places of Worship</span></h3>
<p>Raidush&rsquo;s worship is usually concentrated in towns or cities near locations of destruction. Massive storms ravage the shattered lands and as such there are many temples for him there. There&rsquo;s also the largest temple for the god near mount Eldur in the shattered lands.</p>

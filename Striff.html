<h3><strong>Striff, god of war, victory, and tactics</strong></h3>
<p>Striff, a major god in the pantheon, represents the war that has ravaged the continent ever since it&rsquo;s creation. For empires rise and fall by his hand. He&rsquo;s revered by those seeking victory and tacticians. He has 2 sons, terror, and fear. His daughter is the dread that comes before war.</p>
<h3><span id="Physical_description_and_known_manifestations" class="mw-headline">Physical description and known manifestations</span></h3>
<p>Striff usually appears as a large man wielding a greataxe in one hand and a dove in the other (thought to be Freyur, but not certain) it&rsquo;s said he appears at the sight of great battles to mourn the fallen and set their souls free.</p>
<h3><span id="Places_of_Worship" class="mw-headline">Places of Worship</span></h3>
<p>Striff is the only god that does not have any places of worship, as his worship is only performed on the scorched lands of wars, where prayers echo in the empty landscape of destruction.</p>

<h3><strong>Tofra, goddess of the arcane, medicine, and divine messenger.</strong></h3>
<p>It is said that Tofra is the closest deity to her subjects, as the divine messenger, she&rsquo;s the one which delivers the messages of the divines to mortal souls in need. She also helps Charon and Ana in their jobs by delivering souls. Her time is literally of the essence as she holds some control over the flow of her time, though not as much as Chronos, the god of time himself. She&rsquo;s also the mother of Ellana, the demigod magical shopkeep, or so Ellana claims.</p>
<h3><span id="Physical_Description_and_known_manifestations" class="mw-headline">Physical Description and known manifestations</span></h3>
<p>Tofra appears as a middle-aged woman of divine beauty, wearing a long blue dress and having animated blue hair that flies and flows. She&rsquo;s also known to appear as a sole star in the starless skies of Presia.</p>
<h3><span id="Places_of_Worship" class="mw-headline">Places of Worship</span></h3>
<p>Tofra is usually worshipped by most of the elves on Presia as magic, especially the arcane, is essential to the Presian lifestyle. Her symbol is one sole stars on a blue badge which decorates all of her temples with the warm blue colorscheme.</p>

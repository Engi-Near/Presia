<p>Viet&rsquo;lan, a minor god even within the big 13, is the youngest of the larger pantheon, and as such has little control over his domain. He&rsquo;s the god of knowledge and history, revered by students and seekers of knowledge.</p>
<h3><span id="Physical_description_and_known_manifestations" class="mw-headline">Physical description and known manifestations</span></h3>
<p>Viet&rsquo;lan is usually depicted as a young man wearing golden robes. He&rsquo;s also depicted as a small golden swallow.</p>
<h3><span id="Places_of_Worship" class="mw-headline">Places of Worship</span></h3>
<p>Viet&rsquo;lan&rsquo;s places of worship include all schools and colleges where knowledge is spread. Though he does have some minor temples in small towns where schools would be hard to find, there it&rsquo;s quite expected to find students being taught</p>

<h3><strong>Freyur. God of peace.</strong></h3>
<p>Freyur is one of the less worshipped deities in the land, his worship falls less and less the closer the elves come to war with the drow. He was an ancient king that unified most of the lands and brought peace to all of Presia, and his peace lasted long. People pray for him to bless them with victory over their drow enemies so that this peace may return to the continent.</p>
